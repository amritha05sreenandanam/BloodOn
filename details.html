                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    The Blood Donation Alert System is a social service–driven web platform created to bridge the gap 
                    between urgent medical needs and compassionate individuals willing to help. We connect voluntary 
                    blood donors with hospitals and patients in need, ensuring timely access to life-saving blood donations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our platform transforms moments of crisis into opportunities for collective care, reducing uncertainty 
                    and delay while offering reassurance, responsiveness, and hope when it matters most.
                </p>

                            Currently, you would need to register again with updated information. We're working on

                            That's completely fine! Receiving an alert doesn't obligate you to donate. Only respond 
                            if you're available and willing to help. There are usually multiple donors notified for 
                            each request.

                            Our system prioritizes donors in the same or nearby locations to the hospital. Donors 
                            in the same city or district are notified first, followed by those in nearby areas if needed.
